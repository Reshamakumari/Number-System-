        <h1>What is Number System?</h1>
        <p>
        A number system is defined as the representation of numbers by using digits or other symbols in a consistent manner. 
        The value of any digit in a number can be determined by a digit, its position in the number, and the base of the number system. 
        The numbers are represented in a unique manner and allow us to operate arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, and division.

        <h1><u>Binary Number System</u></h1>
        <p>Binary is a base-2 number system invented by Gottfried Leibniz that's made up of only two numbers or digits: 0 (zero) and 1 (one). This numbering system is the basis for all binary code, which is used to write digital data such as the computer processor instructions used every day.
        </p>
        Binary is still the primary language for computers and used with electronics and computer hardware for the following reasons.
        
        <p>
        It is a simple and elegant design.
        Binary's 0 and 1 method is quick to detect an electrical signal's off (false) or on (true) state.
        Having only two states placed far apart in an electrical signal makes it less susceptible to electrical interference.
        The positive and negative poles of magnetic media are quickly translated to binary.
        Binary is the most efficient way to control logic circuits.

        <h1><u>Decimal Number System</u></h1>
        <p>
            In the decimal number system, the numbers are represented with base 10.
            The way of denoting the decimal numbers with base 10 is also termed as decimal notation.
            This number system is widely used in computer applications. It is also called the base-10 number system which consists of 10 digits, such as, 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
        </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Octal -->
        <div id = "card">
        <h1><u>Octal Number System</u></h1>
        <p>
        A number system which has its base as ‘eight’ is called an Octal number system. 
        It uses numbers from 0 to 7. Let us take an example, to understand the concept. 
        As we said, any number with base 8 is an octal number like 248, 1098, 558, etc.
        </p>
        </div>

        <!-- hexadecimal -->
        <div id = "card">
        <h1><u>Hexadecimal Number System</u></h1>
        <p>
            Hexadecimal number system has the base as 16 (hexa = 6 and deci = 10). So it is also called the base 16 number system. 
            In this number system, there are 16 digits which are used in representing numbers in hexadecimal form. 
            It is similar to the decimal number system because the first 10 digits remain the same in both the number systems. 
            However, 10 in the decimal number system is represented as A in the hexadecimal system, 11 as B, 12 as C, 13 as D, 14 as E, 15 as F and 16 as 10. 
            So the 16 digits of the hexadecimal number system are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F.
